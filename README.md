# DESCRIPTION

This module provides a [Log::Dispatch](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3ADispatch) output sink for logging to
[Test::Simple](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test%3A%3ASimple) diagnostics.

It is similar to [Log::Dispatch::TestDiag](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3ADispatch%3A%3ATestDiag).

# CONSTRUCTOR

The constructor takes the following parameter in addition to the
standard parameters for [Log::Dispatch::Output](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3ADispatch%3A%3AOutput).

## method

This is the logging method, which is either `note` or `diag`
(corresponding to those functions in [Test::More](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test%3A%3AMore)).

# SUPPORT FOR OLDER PERL VERSIONS

Since v0.2.0, the this module requires Perl v5.14 or later.

Future releases may only support Perl versions released in the last ten years.
